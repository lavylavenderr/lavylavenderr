# hewwoooo :3
I'm **Lavender (*or Alexander*) (they/them/theirs)** and this is my GitHub Profile! I'm a fullstack developer, designer, and I am currently touching grass somewhere in North America. I would consider myself to be interested in some fun silly little projects, or even building online communities! I do tend to pick up random projects here and there in my free time, so keep an eye out :3
